# exchange_tax_parsers
Collection of python scripts for pulling trades from crypto exchanges and putting in csv format for tax websites

PLEASE NOTE FOR KUCOIN:
If you have more than 100 trades, the API script does not work to retrieve them all right now (working to see if this is fixable). 
In the meantime, I've added a kucoin_parser_selenium.py script that uses selenium/chromedriver to open an instance of chrome and go thru to grab the trades.

Instructions are included at the top of each script, please read! Thanks!
